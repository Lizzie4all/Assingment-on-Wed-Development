		<p> With the Schema Management feature, you can create, alter, or drop database schema objects such as clusters, indexes, materialized views, tables, and views, as well as view dependencies of schema objects. Storage layout information is also available for a table or an index if they are on EMC devices. 
The Schema Management feature also supports index organized tables, partitioned tables and indexes, advanced queues, Java classes and sources, and unicode. Advanced queuing offers message transformation which can be used to transform and validate message communication amongst different business processes. The unicode feature allows you to select a column of "character" type and specify the length in bytes or characters.
